# Next CMS
Next CMS is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) based content management system designed to be easily usable by non programmers, while allowing designers and programmers to efficiently build websites. At its core, Next CMS uses Next.js for both the frontend and backend. Coupled with on-demand incremental static regeneration (ISR), it allows for dynamic changes to the website while also making it more performant than traditional CMS solutions. It features an intuitive drag and drop page builder that lets designers quickly transform their designs into a website. Users can create color palettes, custom blocks, variants and much more.

## How to Use
Next CMS is currently still in early development. The latest stable version can be found on the main branch, while development releases are on the canary branch. To use Next CMS, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
